Description: To avoid tedious and error-prone spreadsheet work, like copy&paste,
             this package helps to quantify intensities of identified lipids 
             from mass spectra in a safe, fast and reproducible way.
             It provides different filereader-, evaluation-, visualisation- and 
             output-functions.
